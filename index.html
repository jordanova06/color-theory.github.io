					<h2>The Basics</h2>
					<h3>What does color theory represent?</h3>
				</div>

				
					<p>Color is <i>perception</i>. Our eyes see something and data sent from our eyes to our brains tells us it’s a certain color. Objects reflect light in different combinations of wavelengths. Our brains pick up on those wavelength combinations and translate them into the phenomenon we call <u><b>color</b></u>.</p>

					<br/>

					<p>Color theory encompasses a multitude of definitions, concepts and design applications, it’s both the science and the art of using color. It explains how humans perceive color, and the visual effects of how colors mix, match or contrast with each other. Color theory also includes the <b>messages colors convey, and the methods used to replicate color</b>.</p>
					
					<br/>

					<p>Being able to use colors consciously and harmoniously can help you create spectacular results.</p>

				<div class="main-titles">
					<h2>Color Wheel</h2>
					<h3>What is it and how do we utilize it?</h3>
				</div>

				<div class="content">
					<p>The first color wheel was designed by Sir Isaac Newton in 1666 and artists/designers still use it to develop color harmonies, mixing and palettes.</p>

					<br/>

					<p>The color wheel consists of three primary colors (<b>red, yellow, blue</b>), three secondary colors (colors created when primary colors are mixed: <b>green, orange, purple</b>) and six tertiary colors (colors made from primary and secondary colors, such as <b>blue-green or red-violet</b>).
					Draw a line through the center of the wheel, and you’ll separate the warm colors (reds, oranges, yellows) from cool colors (blues, greens, purples).
					</p>

					<br/>

					<p>Traditionally, there are a number of color combinations that are considered especially pleasing. These are called <b>color harmonies or color chords</b> and they consist of two or more colors with a fixed relation in the color wheel.</p>

					<h2>Color Harmony</h2>
					<h3>How to combine colors in a synergetic way?</h3>
				</div>

				<p>Let's introduce some of the basic color chords for creating visually pleasing color schemes, all based on the color wheel.</p>

				<br/>

				<div id="harmonies-container">

					<div class="harmony-box">
						<img src="img/complementary.png">
						<h3>Complementary</h3>
						<p>Colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel are considered to be complementary colors. The high contrast of complementary colors creates a vibrant look especially when used at full saturation. This color scheme must be managed well so it is not jarring.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="harmony-box">
						<img src="img/analogous.png">
						<h3>Analogous</h3>
						<p>Analogous color schemes use colors that are next to each other on the color wheel. They usually match well and create serene and comfortable designs. Analogous color schemes are often found in nature and are harmonious and pleasing to the eye.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="harmony-box">
						<img src="img/triadic.png">
						<h3>Triadic</h3>
						<p>A triadic color scheme uses colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel. Triadic color schemes tend to be quite vibrant, even if you use pale or unsaturated versions of your hues. To use a triadic harmony successfully, the colors should be carefully balanced.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="harmony-box">
						<img src="img/split-complementary.png">
						<h3>Split-complementary</h3>
						<p>The split-complementary color scheme is a variation of the complementary color scheme. In addition to the base color, it uses the two colors adjacent to its complement. This color scheme has the same strong visual contrast as the complementary color scheme, but has less tension.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="harmony-box">
						<img src="img/rectangular.png">
						<h3>Rectangle</h3>
						<p>The rectangle or tetradic color scheme uses four colors arranged into two complementary pairs. This rich color scheme offers plenty of possibilities for variation. Tetradic color schemes works best if you let one color be dominant.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="harmony-box">
						<img src="img/square.png">
						<h3>Square</h3>
						<p>The square color scheme is similar to the rectangle, but with all four colors spaced evenly around the color circle. Square color schemes works best if you let one color be dominant. You should also pay attention to the balance between warm and cool colors in your design.</p>

					<h2>Color Psychology</h2>
					<h3>What colors communicate and how do they influence us?</h3>
				</div>

				<div class="content">
					<p>Colors evoke emotions and moods from people unlike any other. According to ‘Management Decision‘ by Satyendra Singh, people make up their minds within 90 seconds of their initial interactions with websites or products.</p>
						<br/>

					<p><span>About 62‐90% of the assessment is based on colors alone.</span></p>
					
					<br/>
					<p>This is why color plays a huge role in your online appearance. From the color you choose for your headline text to the color you pick for the background,  this color scheme will set the mood for your website and ultimately your brand. Brands and color are inextricably linked because color offers an instantaneous method for conveying meaning and message without words.</p>
